# Around the U.S.
> web_project_3

"From Portland to Portland" (web_project_3) is my second project at Practicum by Yandex. I've done it during the "Adaptive Web Design and Working with Layouts" course. 
In this course, I worked with design specs and turned them into website. I also built interfaces using Grid Layout technology while ensuring that my site looks good on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

## Technologies and Techniques

While developing web_project_3 I used the folowing technologies and techniques:
* Figma - a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows.
* HTML5, CSS3, markdown
* BEM — Block Element Modifier, a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development
* Visual Studio Code, Git 
* Responsive web design, Semantic markup

# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
